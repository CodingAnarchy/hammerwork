# Hammerwork Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned features for Hammerwork, prioritized by impact level and implementation complexity. Features are organized into phases based on their value proposition to users and estimated development effort.

## Phase 3: Specialized Features (üöß IN PROGRESS)
*Features for specific enterprise or compliance requirements*

### ‚úÖ Job Encryption & PII Protection (IMPLEMENTED)
**Impact: Medium** | **Complexity: High** | **Priority: Low-Medium**

Critical for organizations with strict data protection requirements.

**Status**: Core encryption system implemented with AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 support, PII field detection, and retention policies.

```rust
// Encrypt sensitive job payloads
use hammerwork::{Job, encryption::{EncryptionConfig, EncryptionAlgorithm, RetentionPolicy}};

let job = Job::new("process_payment".to_string(), payment_data)
    .with_encryption(EncryptionConfig::new(EncryptionAlgorithm::AES256GCM))
    .with_pii_fields(vec!["credit_card", "ssn"])
    .with_retention_policy(RetentionPolicy::DeleteAfter(Duration::from_secs(7 * 24 * 60 * 60)));
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Access Control & Auditing
**Impact: Medium** | **Complexity: High** | **Priority: Low-Medium**

Required for enterprise environments with compliance requirements.

```rust
// Role-based access control
let worker = Worker::new(queue, "sensitive_queue".to_string(), handler)
    .with_required_permissions(vec!["process_payments", "read_user_data"])
    .with_audit_logging(true);

// Audit trail
let audit_log = queue.get_audit_log(&job_id).await?;
```

### üîó Message Queue Integration
**Impact: Medium** | **Complexity: Medium** | **Priority: Low-Medium**

Valuable for organizations migrating from other queue systems.

```rust
// Integration with external message queues
let bridge = MessageBridge::new()
    .from_rabbitmq("amqp://localhost")
    .to_hammerwork_queue("external_jobs")
    .with_transform(|msg| Job::from_message(msg));
```

## Phase 4: Advanced Scaling Features
*Complex features primarily for large-scale deployments*

### üöÄ Zero-downtime Deployments
**Impact: High** | **Complexity: Very High** | **Priority: Low**

Critical for large-scale production systems but complex to implement correctly.

```rust
// Graceful job migration during deployments
let migration = JobMigration::new()
    .drain_workers(Duration::from_minutes(5))
    .migrate_pending_jobs("old_queue", "new_queue")
    .with_rollback_capability();
```

### üóÇÔ∏è Queue Partitioning & Sharding
**Impact: High** | **Complexity: Very High** | **Priority: Low**

Essential for massive scale but adds significant complexity.

```rust
// Partition jobs across multiple databases
let queue = PartitionedQueue::new()
    .add_partition("shard1", postgres_pool1)
    .add_partition("shard2", postgres_pool2)
    .with_partitioning_strategy(PartitionStrategy::Hash("user_id"));
```

### üåç Multi-region Support
**Impact: Medium** | **Complexity: Very High** | **Priority: Low**

Important for global deployments but extremely complex to implement reliably.

```rust
// Cross-region job replication
let geo_config = GeoReplicationConfig::new()
    .primary_region("us-east-1")
    .replica_regions(vec!["us-west-2", "eu-west-1"])
    .with_failover_policy(FailoverPolicy::Automatic);
```

## Implementation Priority

Features are ordered within each phase by priority and should generally be implemented in the following sequence:

**Phase 3 (Enterprise Features)**
1. Job Encryption & PII Protection
2. Access Control & Auditing
3. Message Queue Integration

**Phase 4 (Scaling Features)**
1. Zero-downtime Deployments
2. Queue Partitioning & Sharding
3. Multi-region Support

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to any of these roadmap items! Please:

1. Open an issue to discuss the feature before implementation
2. Review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines
3. Consider starting with Phase 1 (Advanced Features) for maximum impact
4. Ensure comprehensive tests and documentation for new features

## Feedback

This roadmap is based on anticipated user needs and common job queue patterns. If you have specific requirements or would like to prioritize certain features, please:

- Open a GitHub issue with the `enhancement` label
- Join our community discussions
- Share your use case and requirements

The roadmap will be updated based on user feedback and changing requirements.
