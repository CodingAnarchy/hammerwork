-- Migration 012: Optimize job dependencies (MySQL placeholder)
-- MySQL continues to use JSONB for dependency arrays since it doesn't have native UUID arrays

-- This migration is a no-op for MySQL as the JSONB implementation is already optimal
-- for MySQL's capabilities. PostgreSQL gets native UUID arrays for better performance.

-- Add comment to clarify the difference
