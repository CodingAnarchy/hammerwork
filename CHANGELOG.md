## [0.2.2] - 2025-06-26

### Added
- **Comprehensive Job Timeout Functionality**
  - `TimedOut` job status for jobs that exceed their timeout duration
  - Per-job timeout configuration with `Job::with_timeout()` builder method
  - Worker-level default timeouts with `Worker::with_default_timeout()`
  - Timeout detection using `tokio::time::timeout` for efficient async timeout handling
  - `timeout` and `timed_out_at` fields added to `Job` struct for complete timeout tracking
  - Automatic timeout event recording in statistics with `JobEventType::TimedOut`

- **Enhanced Database Support for Timeouts**
  - `timeout_seconds` and `timed_out_at` columns added to database schema
  - `mark_job_timed_out()` method added to `DatabaseQueue` trait
  - Complete timeout support in both PostgreSQL and MySQL implementations
  - Database queries updated to handle timeout fields in job lifecycle operations
  - Timeout counts integrated into queue statistics with `timed_out_count` field

- **Timeout Statistics and Monitoring**
  - `timed_out` field added to `JobStatistics` for timeout event tracking
  - Timeout events included in error rate calculations for comprehensive metrics
  - `timed_out_count` added to `QueueStats` for per-queue timeout monitoring
  - Enhanced statistics display in examples showing timeout metrics
  - Timeout event processing in `InMemoryStatsCollector`

- **Comprehensive Testing**
  - 14 new comprehensive tests covering timeout functionality
  - Job timeout detection logic testing with edge cases
  - Worker timeout configuration and precedence testing
  - Timeout statistics integration testing
  - Database operation interface testing for timeout methods
  - Job lifecycle testing with timeout scenarios

- **Enhanced Examples**
  - Updated PostgreSQL example with timeout configuration demonstrations
  - Updated MySQL example with various timeout scenarios (10s, 60s, 600s)
  - Job timeout precedence examples (job-specific vs worker defaults)
  - Priority-based timeout configuration examples (VIP vs standard jobs)
  - Comprehensive timeout statistics display in both examples

### Technical Implementation
- Timeout precedence: job-specific timeout takes priority over worker default timeout
- Graceful timeout handling: jobs are marked as `TimedOut` without affecting other jobs
- Async timeout detection: uses `tokio::time::timeout` for efficient resource management
- Database consistency: timeout information persisted and retrievable across job lifecycle
- Statistics integration: timeout events fully integrated into existing statistics framework

## [0.2.1] - 2025-06-25

### Removed
- Removed the `full` feature flag that enabled both PostgreSQL and MySQL simultaneously
  - Users typically choose one database backend per application
  - Simplifies the feature set and reduces unnecessary dependencies
  - Available features are now: `postgres`, `mysql`

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-25

### Added
- **Comprehensive Statistics Tracking**
  - `JobStatistics` struct with detailed metrics (throughput, processing times, error rates)
  - `StatisticsCollector` trait for pluggable statistics backends
  - `InMemoryStatsCollector` with time-windowed data collection and configurable cleanup
  - `QueueStats` for queue-specific insights
  - `DeadJobSummary` for dead job analysis with error patterns
  - `JobEvent` system for tracking job processing lifecycle events
  - Integration with `Worker` and `WorkerPool` for automatic statistics collection

- **Dead Job Management**
  - Enhanced `Job` struct with `failed_at` field and `Dead` status
  - Dead job utility methods: `is_dead()`, `has_exhausted_retries()`, `age()`, `processing_duration()`
  - Database operations for dead job management:
    - `mark_job_dead()` - Mark jobs as permanently failed
    - `get_dead_jobs()` - Retrieve dead jobs with pagination
    - `get_dead_jobs_by_queue()` - Queue-specific dead job retrieval
    - `retry_dead_job()` - Reset dead jobs for retry
    - `purge_dead_jobs()` - Clean up old dead jobs
    - `get_dead_job_summary()` - Summary statistics with error patterns

- **Database Enhancements**
  - Extended `DatabaseQueue` trait with 15 new methods for statistics and dead job management
  - Enhanced database schemas with `failed_at` column and performance indexes
  - Complete feature parity between PostgreSQL and MySQL implementations
  - Optimized queries with proper indexing for performance

- **Testing & Examples**
  - 32 comprehensive unit tests with full coverage of new features
  - Updated examples demonstrating statistics collection and dead job management
  - Enhanced integration tests with 4 new test scenarios:
    - Dead job management lifecycle
    - Statistics collection functionality
    - Database queue statistics
    - Error frequency analysis

### Changed
- Updated package description to highlight new statistics and dead job management features
- Enhanced API with backward-compatible design

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-25

### Added
- **Core Job Queue Infrastructure**
  - `Job` struct with UUID, payload, status, retry logic, and scheduling
  - Job statuses: `Pending`, `Running`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `Retrying`
  - Support for delayed job execution with configurable retry attempts
  - `JobQueue<DB>` generic struct with database connection pooling

- **Worker System**
  - `Worker<DB>` for processing jobs from specific queues
  - Configurable polling intervals, retry delays, and maximum retries
  - `WorkerPool<DB>` for managing multiple workers with graceful shutdown
  - Async channels for coordinated shutdown signaling

- **Database Support**
  - `DatabaseQueue` trait defining interface for database operations
  - Full PostgreSQL implementation with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for efficient job polling

  - Comprehensive error wrapping for SQLx, serialization, and custom errors
  - Integrated tracing support for observability

- **Database Schema**
