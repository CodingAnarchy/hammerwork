## Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup

```bash
# Run migrations to set up the database schema
cargo hammerwork migration run --database-url postgres://localhost/mydb

# Check migration status
cargo hammerwork migration status --database-url postgres://localhost/mydb
```

### 2. Configuration

```bash
# Set your default database URL
cargo hammerwork config set database_url postgres://localhost/mydb

# View current configuration
cargo hammerwork config show

# Set other defaults
cargo hammerwork config set default_queue emails
cargo hammerwork config set log_level debug
```

## Command Structure

The CLI is organized into logical command groups:

### Migration Commands

```bash
# Database migration operations
cargo hammerwork migration run [--database-url URL] [--drop]
cargo hammerwork migration status [--database-url URL]
```

### Configuration Commands

```bash
# Configuration management
cargo hammerwork config show                    # View all settings
cargo hammerwork config set <key> <value>       # Set a configuration value  
cargo hammerwork config get <key>               # Get a specific value
cargo hammerwork config reset --confirm         # Reset to defaults
cargo hammerwork config path                    # Show config file location
```

### Job Management Commands

```bash
# Job lifecycle management
cargo hammerwork job list [--queue QUEUE] [--status STATUS] [--limit N]
cargo hammerwork job show <JOB_ID>              # Detailed job information
cargo hammerwork job enqueue --queue QUEUE --payload JSON [OPTIONS]
cargo hammerwork job retry <JOB_ID>             # Retry a failed job
cargo hammerwork job cancel <JOB_ID>            # Cancel a pending job
cargo hammerwork job delete <JOB_ID>            # Remove a job
cargo hammerwork job requeue-stale [--older-than-secs N]  # Reclaim jobs stuck in Running
```

`job requeue-stale` moves `Running` jobs whose lease has expired (their worker crashed
or was killed) back to `Pending`, or to `Dead` when they have no attempts left. Jobs
that never recorded a lease are reclaimed once they started more than
`--older-than-secs` ago (default 3600). It is safe to run alongside workers, and needs
migration `015_add_job_leases`.

### Worker Management Commands

```bash
# Running jobs and the worker leases (heartbeats) behind them, per queue
cargo hammerwork worker status [--queue QUEUE] [--jobs]
```

Hammerwork has no worker registry: workers live inside your applications, so the CLI
cannot list, start or stop them. `worker status` reports what the database records: the
`Running` jobs of each queue with their lease (`last_heartbeat_at` / `lease_expires_at`)
and flags expired leases, which mean a worker stopped heartbeating. Reclaim those jobs
with `job requeue-stale`. Needs migration `015_add_job_leases`.

### Queue Management Commands

```bash
# Queue operations and statistics
cargo hammerwork queue list                     # List all queues
cargo hammerwork queue stats [--queue QUEUE]    # Queue statistics
cargo hammerwork queue clear --queue QUEUE      # Clear all jobs
cargo hammerwork queue pause --queue QUEUE      # Pause processing
cargo hammerwork queue resume --queue QUEUE     # Resume processing
```

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Real-time monitoring and health checks
cargo hammerwork monitor dashboard              # Live dashboard
cargo hammerwork monitor health [--format json] # System health check
cargo hammerwork monitor metrics [--period 1h]  # Performance metrics
```

### Webhook Commands

```bash
cargo hammerwork webhook add --name ci --url https://example.com/hook [--auth-token T] [--secret S]
cargo hammerwork webhook list [--detailed]
cargo hammerwork webhook update|toggle|remove ...
cargo hammerwork webhook test --webhook ci [--event-type failed]   # Sends a real request
```

Webhooks are stored as JSON in `webhooks.json` next to `config.toml` (override with
`HAMMERWORK_WEBHOOKS_FILE`; written owner-only because it can hold tokens and secrets).
`webhook test` sends one sample event to the URL with the configured method, headers,
authentication and `X-Hammerwork-Signature` HMAC, prints the response, and exits non-zero
if the endpoint is unreachable or answers with an error status. The file is a registry
for the CLI only: delivery from your application is configured in code with
`WebhookManager`. There is no `webhook stats` (delivery statistics only exist in the
memory of the process running the manager) and no `streaming` command.

### Batch Operation Commands

```bash
# Bulk job operations
cargo hammerwork batch create --jobs FILE       # Create job batch
cargo hammerwork batch status <BATCH_ID>        # Batch progress
cargo hammerwork batch retry <BATCH_ID>         # Retry failed jobs
cargo hammerwork batch cancel <BATCH_ID>        # Cancel batch
```

### Cron Management Commands

```bash
# Recurring job scheduling
cargo hammerwork cron list                      # List cron jobs
cargo hammerwork cron add --schedule "0 */6 * * *" --queue QUEUE --payload JSON
cargo hammerwork cron remove <JOB_ID>           # Remove cron job
cargo hammerwork cron enable <JOB_ID>           # Enable scheduling
cargo hammerwork cron disable <JOB_ID>          # Disable scheduling
```

### Maintenance Commands

```bash
# Database maintenance and optimization
cargo hammerwork maintenance cleanup            # Remove old completed jobs
cargo hammerwork maintenance vacuum             # Optimize database
cargo hammerwork maintenance analyze            # Update table statistics
cargo hammerwork maintenance health             # Database health check

# Enforce retention policies of encrypted jobs: delete finished encrypted jobs
# (and archived ones) whose retention period has ended. Needs no encryption key.
cargo hammerwork maintenance purge-encrypted --dry-run
cargo hammerwork maintenance purge-encrypted --confirm
```

`cargo hammerwork job show` prints the redacted payload of an encrypted job (the CLI never decrypts) together with its key id, algorithm and retention.

### Workflow Commands

```bash
# Job dependencies and complex pipelines
cargo hammerwork workflow create --file WORKFLOW.json
cargo hammerwork workflow list                  # List active workflows
cargo hammerwork workflow status <WORKFLOW_ID>  # Workflow progress
cargo hammerwork workflow cancel <WORKFLOW_ID>  # Cancel workflow
```

### Spawn Operation Commands

```bash
# Dynamic job spawning and parent-child relationships
cargo hammerwork spawn list [--queue QUEUE] [--recent] [--limit N]
cargo hammerwork spawn tree <JOB_ID> [--format text|json|mermaid] [--full]
cargo hammerwork spawn stats [--queue QUEUE] [--hours N] [--detailed]
cargo hammerwork spawn lineage <JOB_ID> [--ancestors] [--descendants] [--depth N]
cargo hammerwork spawn pending [--queue QUEUE] [--show-config]
cargo hammerwork spawn monitor [--queue QUEUE] [--interval N]
```

### Backup Commands

```bash
# Database backup and recovery
cargo hammerwork backup create --output FILE    # Create backup
cargo hammerwork backup restore --input FILE    # Restore from backup
cargo hammerwork backup list                    # List available backups
cargo hammerwork backup verify --input FILE     # Verify backup integrity
```

cargo run -p cargo-hammerwork -- migration status --database-url mysql://root:hammerwork@localhost:3307/hammerwork
```

### Test Database Management

The project includes convenient scripts for managing test databases:

```bash
# From the project root directory:

# Set up test databases
./scripts/setup-test-databases.sh both      # Both PostgreSQL and MySQL
./scripts/setup-test-databases.sh postgres  # PostgreSQL only
./scripts/setup-test-databases.sh mysql     # MySQL only

# Check database status
./scripts/setup-test-databases.sh status

# Run integration tests
./scripts/setup-test-databases.sh test

# Stop databases
./scripts/setup-test-databases.sh stop

# Remove databases
./scripts/setup-test-databases.sh remove
```

Test database connection strings:
- PostgreSQL: `postgres://postgres:hammerwork@localhost:5433/hammerwork`
- MySQL: `mysql://root:hammerwork@localhost:3307/hammerwork`
